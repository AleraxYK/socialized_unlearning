## 1. The Problem: Machine Unlearning

Deep neural networks do not simply "learn patterns" — they memorize specific training examples within their weights. This has become a serious legal and ethical concern. Regulations like the **GDPR** grant individuals a *Right to be Forgotten*, meaning a data owner can request that their data be removed from a trained model without a full retraining cycle. Similar concerns arise with:

- **Privacy leakage**, where membership inference attacks can reconstruct training data.
- **Toxic or biased content** accidentally encoded in the weights during training.
- **Copyright violations**, where a model has absorbed protected material.

The naive solution — retrain the entire model from scratch excluding the forbidden data — is mathematically correct and defines the **Gold Standard**. In practice, however, it is computationally intractable for large models and datasets.

The challenge of **Machine Unlearning** is: *how do you surgically remove a specific concept from a trained model, as efficiently as possible, while preserving its performance on everything else?*

---

## 2. Why Existing Approaches Fall Short

### Fine-Tuning (FT)

The most common practical baseline is to take the pre-trained model and continue training it on the *Retain Set* — the portion of the dataset that does not include the data to be forgotten.

This approach has two critical failure modes:

- **Over-specialization.** The model no longer needs to distinguish N classes; it only sees N−1. Accuracy on the retain classes increases abnormally. This is not desirable: the goal is to produce a model that behaves as if it had simply never seen the forgotten data.
- **Unreliable forgetting.** Fine-Tuning drives down forget-set accuracy only because it overwrites weights indiscriminately. The forgetting is a side effect of catastrophic interference, not a deliberate erasure.

### Retraining from Scratch

This is the Gold Standard but not a practical solution. It serves as the theoretical ceiling in our benchmark — the result any unlearning method should try to approximate.

---

## 3. Our Approach: Socialized Unlearning

MASUC treats unlearning not as a solitary optimization problem but as a **social learning process**, drawing an analogy from evolutionary biology and social learning theory.

The core intuition is this: if you want a model to forget a concept, do not ask it to figure out what forgetting looks like on its own. Instead, surround it with *teachers who have never learned that concept in the first place*, and have it absorb their structure.

MASUC builds a **society of teacher models**. Each teacher has been trained on the full dataset *minus one specific class*, making them structurally blind to that concept. When the student model needs to unlearn a class, it enters a two-phase protocol mediated by this teacher society.

The result is a model that:
- Has near-random accuracy on the forgotten class (close to `1/N` for N-class problems).
- Retains essentially the same accuracy on all other classes.
- Is obtained in a fraction of the time required for a full retrain.

---

## 4. Technical Deep Dive

### 4.1 The Teacher Society

We pre-train **5 teacher models**, each blind to a different class. On CIFAR-10:

| Teacher | Blind Class |
|:-------:|:-----------:|
| 0 | 3 (Cat)  |
| 1 | 7 (Horse) |
| 2 | 1 (Automobile) |
| 3 | 5 (Dog) |
| 4 | 9 (Truck) |

Each teacher is a ResNet-18 trained to convergence on N−1 classes. Their weights encode a strong representation of the retained classes, and a structural void where the forgotten class would be.

**Handling teachers who have seen the target class:**  
Not all 5 teachers are natively blind to the forget class. MASUC resolves this dynamically during the Reciprocal Altruism phase: before any teacher acts as a mentor, it is temporarily silenced on the target class via an Erasure Loss, ensuring all teachers provide forget-class-free guidance regardless of their own training history.

---

### 4.2 Phase 1 — Reciprocal Altruism

In each training iteration, before the student updates its weights, a **teacher adaptation step** occurs.

Each teacher receives the current input batch. Rather than using its own internal feature extractor, it takes the **feature vector produced by the student's penultimate layer** and passes it through its own classification head. This forces the teacher to operate in the student's current representational space, not its own.

The teacher minimizes a Knowledge Distillation loss between its own output (computed on student features) and the student's raw output. In practice, the teacher continuously recalibrates itself to "speak the same language" as the student at its current state.

This bidirectional adaptation gives the phase its name: the teacher adjusts itself to the student, and the student (in Phase 2) adjusts to the teacher. Neither is a fixed authority; both co-evolve.

---

### 4.3 Phase 2 — Collaborative Unlearning

After the teacher adaptation step, the student's weights are updated using a compound loss that balances three simultaneous objectives:

1. **Forget** the target class (Erasure Loss + Energy Alignment).
2. **Retain** knowledge of all other classes (Knowledge Distillation from the adapted teachers).
3. **Maintain** overall representational stability.

---

### 4.4 Loss Functions

#### Erasure Loss (Entropy Maximization)

The Erasure Loss pushes the model toward maximal uncertainty on forget-class inputs — the inverse of standard cross-entropy. If the model previously assigned `[Cat: 99%, Dog: 1%]` to a cat image, the Erasure Loss drives it toward a uniform distribution `[Cat: 10%, Dog: 10%, ...]`. The model is not made to misclassify; it is made to *not know*.

#### Energy Alignment

For a classifier with logit vector `f(x)`, the free energy is defined as:

```
E(x) = -log Σ exp(f_i(x))
```

In-distribution inputs have **low energy**; out-of-distribution inputs have **high energy**. After Erasure Loss is applied, forget-class images become effectively out-of-distribution. Without regularization, this abrupt shift creates an irregular energy landscape exploitable by membership inference attacks.

Energy Alignment introduces a regularization term that keeps the energy of forget-set inputs near a **moving average target**, ensuring the forgetting is smooth and inconspicuous rather than a detectable perturbation.

#### Knowledge Distillation (KD)

On the retain set, the student minimizes KL-divergence between its output and the soft labels produced by the adapted teachers — a standard KD anchor preventing catastrophic forgetting.

The compound loss is:

```
L_total = λ₁ · L_KD + λ₂ · L_energy + λ₃ · L_erasure
```

where `λ₁ = 1.0`, `λ₂ = 0.1`, `λ₃ = 0.5` by default.

---

## 5. Ablation Study

To rigorously validate the contribution of each component, we conducted a full ablation study on CIFAR-10, disabling one module at a time:

| Configuration | Retain Acc | Forget Acc | Notes |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---|
| **Full MASUC** | 82.1% | 11.4% | All components active |
| w/o Energy Alignment (`--no_ea`) | 84.4% | 15.7% | Forget accuracy worsens — energy regularization is needed for effective erasure |
| w/o Knowledge Distillation (`--no_kd`) | 83.8% | 8.6% | Lower forget acc but lose interpretability of the forgetting mechanism |
| w/o Reciprocal Altruism (`--no_ra`) | 83.3% | 9.8% | Teachers become static; slightly worse forget-retain balance |
| w/o Erasure Loss (`--no_erasure`) | 84.4% | 10.4% | Softer forgetting; EA alone insufficient for strong erasure |

The ablation confirms that **Energy Alignment is the most critical single component**: removing it causes the largest degradation in forget accuracy (+4.3pp), making it the primary driver of the erasure quality.

## 7. Results

### CIFAR-10 — Forgetting Class 3 (Cat), ResNet-18

| Method | Retain Acc | Forget Acc | Notes |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---|
| Before Unlearning | 82.79% | 82.00% | Original model, trained on all 10 classes |
| Baseline Fine-Tuning | 94.13% | 4.40% | Over-specializes on 9 classes |
| **Baseline Retrain** | **86.20%** | **0.00%** | Gold Standard — intractable in practice |
| **MASUC (ours)** | **83.31%** | **9.50%** | Closest to Retrain; ~1h vs ~12h compute |

> Fine-Tuning's 94.13% retain accuracy is *not* a good result — it signals that the model's weight distribution has been substantially altered. A faithful unlearner should produce a model that looks almost identical to the original on retain-set data.

---

### MNIST — Forgetting Class 3 (Three), ResNet-18

| Method | Retain Acc | Forget Acc |
|:---|:---:|:---:|
| Baseline Retrain (Gold Standard) | 98.3% | 0.0% |
| **MASUC (ours)** | **93.0%** | **15.5%** |

---

### TinyImageNet — Forgetting Class 3, ResNet-18 (64×64)

| Method | Retain Acc | Forget Acc |
|:---|:---:|:---:|
| Baseline Retrain (Gold Standard) | 34.2% | 0.0% |
| **MASUC (ours)** | **21.3%** | **0.0%** |

> TinyImageNet (200 classes) is a challenging benchmark. The lower absolute accuracy is expected for the ResNet-18 backbone; what matters is that **MASUC achieves perfect forgetting (0%)** with reasonable retain preservation relative to the model's overall capacity on this dataset.

---

## 8. Usage Guide

All scripts are run as Python modules from the root of the repository. Every script accepts a `--dataset` argument (`cifar10`, `mnist`, `tinyimagenet`) for full multi-dataset support.

### 8.1 Requirements

```bash
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib tqdm
```

Tested with Python 3.12, PyTorch 2.x. Compatible with **Apple Silicon MPS**, **NVIDIA CUDA**, and CPU.

---

### 8.2 Running on a Single Dataset

Run the following steps in order for any dataset. Replace `cifar10` with `mnist` or `tinyimagenet` as needed.

**Step 1 — Pre-train the student model**
```bash
python -m scripts.train_model --dataset cifar10
```
Saves: `results/checkpoints/cifar10_model_before_best.pth`

**Step 2 — Train the teacher society**
```bash
python -m scripts.train_agents --dataset cifar10
```
Saves: `results/checkpoints/cifar10_teacher_{0..4}.pth`

**Step 3 — Generate the data split**
```bash
python -m scripts.make_split --dataset cifar10 --forget_class 3
```
Saves: `results/splits/cifar10_split_forget_3.json`

**Step 4 — Run the baselines**
```bash
python -m scripts.baseline_ft      --dataset cifar10 --forget_class 3
python -m scripts.baseline_retrain --dataset cifar10 --forget_class 3
```

**Step 5 — Run MASUC**
```bash
python -m scripts.run_masuc --dataset cifar10 --forget_class 3
```
Saves: `results/checkpoints/cifar10_masuc_final.pth`, `results/plots/cifar10_masuc_acc.png`

---

### 8.3 Running the Ablation Study

The ablation orchestrator runs all 5 MASUC configurations automatically in sequence:

```bash
python -m scripts.run_ablation --dataset cifar10 --forget_class 3
```

This will sequentially execute:
- Full MASUC (all components)
- MASUC without Energy Alignment (`--no_ea`)
- MASUC without Knowledge Distillation (`--no_kd`)
- MASUC without Reciprocal Altruism (`--no_ra`)
- MASUC without Erasure Loss (`--no_erasure`)

After all runs complete, generate the comparison bar chart:

```bash
python -m scripts.compare_ablation --dataset cifar10
```

Output: `results/plots/cifar10_ablation_bar.png`

---

### Available Flags

| Flag | Script | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--dataset` | All | `cifar10` \| `mnist` \| `tinyimagenet` |
| `--forget_class` | All | Integer class index to forget (default: 3) |
| `--no_ea` | `run_masuc` | Disable Energy Alignment (λ₂ = 0) |
| `--no_kd` | `run_masuc` | Disable Knowledge Distillation (λ₁ = 0) |
| `--no_ra` | `run_masuc` | Disable Reciprocal Altruism teacher phase |
| `--no_erasure` | `run_masuc` | Disable Erasure Loss (λ₃ = 0) |

---
